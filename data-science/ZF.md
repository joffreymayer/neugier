## Python Codes - Useful "Tricks"

### View Dataset - How to display all Columns and not skip the Middle Part when Viewing the Ddset

When viewing large ddsets with `dd.head()`, the problem is that it will not display all the colums. However, you can change this default-behavior by using only one  simple line of code:

```
pd.set_option(â€˜display.max_columnsâ€™, None)
houses.head() # check if it worked? --> Note: it must be a large ddset, otherwise you may not see how the default-behavior gets over-written.
```

> How to revert back to the default-behavior?

```
pd.reset_option(â€˜display.max_columnsâ€™)
```

> Custom number of columns shown?

You can tweak the number of default rows shown:

```
pd.set_option(â€˜display.max_rowsâ€™, 5)
```

> In combination with the `plotly`-package?

Note that you need to have `plotly` installed to be able to do this:

```
pd.set_option(â€˜plotting.backendâ€™, â€˜plotlyâ€™)
```

### Data Exploration - Make a (Lower Triangular) Correlation Matrix

```
houses = pd.read_csv('data/melb_data.csv')

# Calculate pairwise-correlation
matrix = houses.corr()

# Create a mask
mask = np.triu(np.ones_like(matrix, dtype=bool))

# Create a custom diverging palette
cmap = sns.diverging_palette(250, 15, s=75, l=40,
                             n=9, center="light", as_cmap=True)

plt.figure(figsize=(16, 12))

sns.heatmap(matrix, mask=mask, center=0, annot=True,
             fmt='.2f', square=True, cmap=cmap)

plt.show();
```

> What does the correlation matrix do?

**It shows the _pairwise_ correlation between your different variables.**

> Why do you need a correlation matrix?

To get a **quick overview** of how all your columns are pairwisely correlated with each other. It helps to do _feature engineering_.

> Why should it be lower-triangular?

Because a correlation matrix is **symmetrical along the main diagonal**, you only need the lower triangular. Also, since the diagonal only shows the correlation of a feature with itself (e.g. always shows a correlation of 1), we don't need the diagonal, but *only the lower-diagonal*. ðŸ˜„

### Data Cleaning for Missing Values - Display proportion of Missing Values across all Columns of a Ddset

```
missing_props = houses.isna().sum() / len(houses)
missing_props[missing_props > 0].sort_values(ascending=False
```

> Why you should always display the proportion of missings in a column?

By knowing the proportion of the missing values, you can make a decision as to **whether to drop or impute values for a column with missing values**.
